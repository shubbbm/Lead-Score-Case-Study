# Lead-Score-Case-Study


**Business Problem:**

X Education, an online course provider, faces a challenge with a low lead conversion rate of 30%. To improve efficiency, the company aims to identify 'Hot Leads' with higher conversion potential. The objective is to build a predictive model that assigns lead scores, allowing the sales team to prioritize communication with leads most likely to convert. The CEO's target is to achieve an 80% lead conversion rate. The goal is to optimize the lead conversion process and increase the effectiveness of the sales team's efforts.
